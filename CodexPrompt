Prompt for Codex — “Is This Website Down?” Web App

PROMPT START

Build a complete “Is This Website Down?” web application.

Architecture

Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite

Backend: Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI) — choose one and implement

Backend performs actual availability checks (browser cannot)

Styling: TailwindCSS

Provide Dockerfile(s) for frontend and backend

Provide docker-compose.yml

Must be deployable on GCP Cloud Run

Clean, simple folder structure

Purpose

The tool must tell the user whether a website is UP or DOWN by performing real HTTP checks from the backend.

The focus:
Simple, reliable, fast, and clear results — not a full uptime monitor (separate tool).

Core Features
1. Basic Website Status Check

The backend must perform:

DNS resolution

HTTP HEAD or GET request (configurable)

Redirection following (max 5)

SSL certificate check (if HTTPS)

Response time measurement

The result must classify the website as:

UP (reachable, valid 2xx–3xx)

DOWN (timeout, unreachable, no DNS)

ERROR (5xx, SSL errors, malformed redirect chain)

Return JSON:

{
  "target": "https://example.com",
  "ip": "93.184.216.34",
  "status": "UP",
  "http_status": 200,
  "response_time_ms": 142,
  "resolved_url": "https://example.com",
  "redirect_chain": ["http://example.com", "https://example.com"],
  "ssl": {
    "used": true,
    "valid": true,
    "expires": "2025-03-01T12:00:00Z",
    "days_remaining": 43
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}

2. DNS Resolution

Before checking, backend resolves:

A

AAAA

CNAME

If DNS fails → result = DOWN

3. Response-Time Reporting

Show:

total response time

per-phase timing (DNS, TCP, SSL), if supported

4. Error Handling

Provide human-readable messages for:

no DNS

connection refused

timeout

SSL error

bad redirect chain

malformed URL

Frontend Requirements
Main UI

Input field: website URL

Button: “Check if the site is down”

Display a big, bold UP/DOWN result

Under the main result, display:

HTTP status

Response time

Resolved IP

Redirect chain

SSL validity + days remaining

UX Additions

Dark/light mode toggle

Example quick buttons:

google.com

wikipedia.org

github.com

Local history (last 5 checks) stored in localStorage

Proper validation for malformed URLs

Loading indicator

Backend Requirements
Endpoints
1. GET /check?url=https://example.com

Backend performs:

URL validation

DNS lookup

HTTP request with timeout (max 10s)

Redirect following (max 5)

SSL certificate extraction

Return JSON result as specified above.

Safety Rules

Reject:

private IPs

localhost

internal networks

invalid or empty URLs

Limit:

max 1 request per 3 seconds per IP (basic rate limit)

DevOps & Deliverables

Provide:

Full frontend source code

Full backend source code

Dockerfile (frontend)

Dockerfile (backend)

docker-compose.yml

Tailwind config, Vite config, tsconfig

README with:

local setup

Docker usage

Cloud Run deployment

Example responses

Unit tests for backend:

DNS failure

timeout

redirect chain logic

SSL parsing
